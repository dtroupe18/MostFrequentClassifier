     *  Complete this class, it is your choice if you want to use an
     *  object or just static methods. Here is a brief description of
     *  what the most frequent classifier should do:
     *
     *  1. Find the most frequent label in the training data (0, or 1)
     *  2. Classify every data point in the testing data with the most frequent label
     *  3. Calculate the accuracy of your predictions
     *
     *          Why would anyone use a classifier that's so simple?
